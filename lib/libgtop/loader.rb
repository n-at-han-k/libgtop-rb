module GTop
  # Defines everything in the GTop namespace from `GTop-2.0.typelib`.
  #
  # Modelled on ruby-gnome's own loaders -- see
  # gtksourceview5/lib/gtksourceview5/loader.rb for one that has to call the
  # library's init function before anything works, and
  # libsecret/lib/libsecret/loader.rb for one that does not.
  #
  # The version string is the typelib's, which is not always the library's
  # release number and is not guessable: this one is "2.0", read off
  # `GTop-2.0.typelib` rather than inferred.

    # A Ruby constant has to begin with an uppercase letter, and this typelib
    # has names that do not. GTop-2.0 declares lowercase struct names such as `glibtop_mountentry`.
    # The default loader calls const_set regardless, which raises NameError
    # (or warns, for a lowercase name) and aborts the load partway through.
    #
    # ruby-gnome's own loaders override this hook for the same reason -- see
    # vte4 and webkit-gtk, which redirect `*_VERSION` constants into a Version
    # module. Here the values are kept in a hash rather than dropped, so
    # nothing in the typelib becomes unreachable.
